# Design Patterns in Go

Used to learn from **Go Design Patterns for Real-World Projects** and **[Concurrency in Go](https://www.amazon.com/Concurrency-Go-Tools-Techniques-Developers/dp/1491941197)** books with some corrections and adaptations to Go 1.23 features and deprecations. The first book has many problems.

[Codeium](http://codeium.com) was used to generate the documentation.
